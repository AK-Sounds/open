# Open

> *Designed for desktop browsers.*

[*Open*](https://stereo-images.github.io/open/) began with the sound of cathedral bells drifting through an open window. The sound belonged in that room, and I felt its absence when I later moved. That memory became the wellspring for this piece.

Instead of recording bells, I went in the opposite direction: a browser window. No particular scene, no particular place, just a sparse frame for sound to travel through. This music is my way of exploring what can come through that digital window, and what I can build inside it.

The piece makes low, synthetic bell tones. While they’re tuned to a clear set of notes, their internal harmonics are messy, creating tension between a steady melody and an ambiguous bell. Each new session begins from a different seed, and the sounds move slowly, drifting over time so that nothing repeats in a short loop. Notes appear, fade out, and leave space.

The sounds do not ask for your attention. They sit alongside and maybe enhance whatever else is happening: the light in your room, the noise outside, or the work you're doing.

*Open* is meant to run quietly in the background with minimal fuss: no logins and no saved settings. You can change the tone or the duration. Each run is temporary, and when the sound stops, it’s gone.

### "Infinite" Mode and Structure
When set to “Infinite,” the piece becomes a long-form drift using specific harmonic and melodic logic.

* **Circle of Fifths:** Slowly moves by fifths through closely related keys, with intermittent toggles into the relative minor.
* **Contour:** The melody is not random; it uses a constrained random walk. A "gravity" system pulls notes toward a central register, preventing the melody from reaching too high or too low while ensuring no two phrases are identical.
* **Tension:** As structural tension rises (especially around peaks), the bell timbre becomes more fractured—brighter, less stable, and harmonically more ambiguous. Cadences tend to simplify the tone again.

### Technical Architecture
*Open* is built on the standard Web Audio API without external libraries. The engine features specific acoustic modeling to achieve the physical weight of the sound.

* **Synthesis:** Notes are generated by FM oscillator pairs. Like the imperfections of cast metal, each note triggers a cluster of 2 to 3 voices with inharmonic ratios.
* **Physics:** The engine models physical decay by reducing the Modulation Index (brightness) faster than the Amplitude (volume). The sound starts bright and fades into a pure sine wave.
* **Acoustics:**
    * **Impulse Response:** A custom convolution reverb with a 10-second tail and 2.8s decay.
    * **Pre-Delay (45ms):** A gap between the dry sound and the reverb to simulate distance.
    * **Filter (4200Hz):** The reverb return is low-passed to remove digital harshness while keeping the upper harmonics.
* **Dynamics:** During dense sections, the reverb level is managed to prevent muddying. Before structural peaks, the reverb briefly cuts out (the "Shadow" state) and swells back in to create spatial movement.

### Usage
1. **Launch:** Click "Open" to start the audio.
2. **Tone:** Use the slider to set the fundamental frequency (Safety floor: 100Hz).
3. **Duration:** Select a fixed time (1m, 5m, 10m, 30m) or Infinite.
